            Hi! I&#39;m <span>Lonn Doneill Calpatura</span>, but you can call me <span>Onyl</span>. I&#39;m an aspiring web developer with a passion for meticulously crafting websites that help organisations grow and thrive. Though new to the industry, I&#39;m confident in my skills and quick to adapt, always eager to learn and improve. I enjoy finding the perfect balance between structure and spontaneityâ€”because, hey, life&#39;s more fun that way!
        </p>
        <p>
          I also have extensive experience in the <span>Audio & Visual (AV) industry</span>, having volunteered at my church for half my life. Moving from team member to department head, I&#39;ve gained valuable skills in AV and workforce <span>systems</span>, <span>teamwork</span>, and <span>leadership</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outisde of coding or AV projects, I love staying active by <span>bouldering</span>, playing <span>volleyball</span>, and <span>badminton</span>. And of course, being in the tech world, I have a big love for <span>all things tech</span> and <span>gaming</span>!
